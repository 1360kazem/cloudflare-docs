Cloudflare's authoritative DNS offering covers a variety of [setups](/dns/zone-setups/).

For the most common setup, Cloudflare will work as your primary DNS provider. This means that the **DNS** > **Records** page is where you will control which resources are available on the apex domain (`example.com`) or specific subdomains (`blog.example.com`) of your website, as well as control other configurations.

The following links introduce important concepts and guide you through actions you may need to take while having your website or application on Cloudflare.

- [DNS records](/dns/manage-dns-records/): DNS records communicate information about your domain to visitors and other web services.

- [Nameservers](/dns/nameservers/): In the context of Cloudflare DNS, nameservers refer to authoritative nameservers. When a nameserver is authoritative for `example.com`, it means that DNS resolvers will consider responses from this nameserver when a user tries to access `example.com`.

- [Proxy status](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/): Proxy status determines how Cloudflare treats incoming HTTP/S requests to A, AAAA, and CNAME records. When a record is proxied, Cloudflare speeds up and protects HTTP/S traffic with our [cache](/cache/)/[CDN](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/), [DDoS protection](/ddos-protection/), [WAF](/waf/), and [more](/products/?product-group=Application+performance%2CApplication+security).
